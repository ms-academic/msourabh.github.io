  <h1>Happy Father’s Day, Daddy ❤️</h1>

  <div class="post">
    <h2>15th June 2025</h2>
    <p>
      Now that I am a dad myself, I envy the way you balanced so many roles with such grace and strength.
      You were a provider, a protector, and a mentor, and I've learnt a lot from observing you.
      Your unwavering zeal and perseverance have always been my benchmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your love came in so many beautiful forms. You made sure we never lacked life’s essentials,
      cooked us the most comforting meals, stood up for us when it mattered, prayed quietly for our health, success, well-being,
      and sacrificed more than we probably ever realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      You got your strength from our smiles, silently endured life’s challenges with the sole objective of seeing us grow,
      succeed, and stand on our own. The pride in your eyes whenever we accomplished something gave us strength we didn't know we had.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may not have been the best son, but you were — and always will be — the perfect father to me.
      Tough when the world demanded it, yet endlessly caring, loving and selfless to the extent of sacrificing yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I miss you, Dad. There’s so much I wish I could tell you, so many thoughts to discuss with you.
      But I carry your lessons, your love, and your memories with me every day and try to be just a cent of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are my envy, you are my pride. Love you and miss you. ❤️
